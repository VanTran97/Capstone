Register and Login to database

1. Make two new folders named 'models' and 'routes'.
2. Move 'api.js' into 'routes' and 'user.js' into 'models'.
3. Download Node.js if not installed. Otherwise, enable Node.js on the folder. Use cmd and change the directory to the server folder, then use 'npm init -y' command. It should make a file named 'package.json' in the folder.
4. Install the dependencies using 'npm install express body-parser mongoose --save' command. It should make a folder named 'node_modules' containing express, body-parser and mongoose folders.
5. Use the command 'npm server' to turn on the server. It should connect to localhost and mongodb in the terminal.
6. Go on web browser and enter 'localhost:3000'.
